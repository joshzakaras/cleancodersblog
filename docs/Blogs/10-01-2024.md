# 10-01-2024 | Stubs!

Stubs are pretty cool. I recently learned about them while writing a game of tic tac toe. I needed a way to handle testing
functions for user input automatically, and was at a bit of a loss. Then I learned about stubs. What stubs do is essentially
replace the function you stub with a dummy function, and you can tell that dummy function to do a few different things, such as
return a predetermined value. One other common use case I had for it was stopping println functions, if I just stub println, then while testing,
no functions will put anything in the terminal, which is really nice for test formatting. 

```clojure
  (it "starts a new game"
    (with-redefs [terminal/print-new-game-alert (stub :new-game-alert)
                  terminal/print-input-format (stub :input-format)
                  terminal/get-game-type (stub :get-game-type)
                  sut/game-loop (stub :game-loop)]
      (sut/tic-tac-toe)
      (should-have-invoked :new-game-alert)
      (should-have-invoked :input-format)))
```

In this example, I use stubs to stop the print functions, as well as prevent the function I'm testing from calling an infinite loop function
that would prevent my test function from completing. You end up having to chase down a few different things however.
When testing the infinite looping function for example, I used a stub to return a completed grid that exits the program, as seen below.
```clojure
    (it "has the computer play o's turn if the computer mode is selected"
      (with-redefs [cpu/play-computer-turn (stub :play-computer-turn {:return [[:x :o :x]
                                                                     [:x :o :o]
                                                                     [:o :x :x]]})
                    sut/player-turn (stub :turn {:return [[:x :o :x]
                                                          [:x :o :o]
                                                          [:o :x :x]]})
                    println (stub :println)]
        (sut/game-loop [["" "" ""]
                        ["" :x ""]
                        ["" "" ""]] :versus-computer)
        (should-have-invoked :play-computer-turn {:with [[["" "" ""]
                                                     ["" :x ""]
                                                     ["" "" ""]]]}))))
```
