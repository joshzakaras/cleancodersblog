## 11-11-2024 | Minimax

Minimax is a pretty cool algorithm that does a really good job of selecting moves in a 1v1 game. It works by
checking every possible move, and assigning them a score, then selecting the highest possible value. If it's checking for the current turn, and the game doesn't
end, it runs minimax again, however this time looking for the lowest possible value. You end up with a recursive function that
makes it impossible to lose.
