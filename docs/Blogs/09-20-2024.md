In my tic-tac-toe project, I have been thinking of all the different ways I can design this thing. What I ended up with was honestly quite simple,
and I feel like it was almost not worth the time I spent on it. However, I did do some things in order to alleviate design stress. My actual
tic-tac-toe file is only 1 (technically 2 but one just calls the other and nothing else) function. However, I have 2 other files that are
separated from the tic-tac-toe file, the game board file and the terminal UI file. It was pretty nice developing like this,
as I was basically just able to TDD features I wanted without having to worry about the impact it would have on the code,
and everything related to that. It feels like it made my code a lot more organized and readable as well.
