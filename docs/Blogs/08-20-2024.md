Today I grinded out the start of the Clojure Koens, I got through the first 15 topics, and hopefully I will be able
to get the rest knocked out by the end of the week. Most of what I was learning was essentially how to program in clojure
and what is different about it compared to the languages I'm used to. The biggest change is that Closure is a functional
language, which means that everything you reference is a function. For example, an if statement is just a function
with arguments that has an argument for the true/false statement you are checking, and the other arguments are paths the
if statement will take depending on the result. The other biggest change is the syntax of the language. Every function is
structured inside of parenthesis, so the if statement I referenced earlier is structured like `(if arg arg arg)`. Even conditionals
are structured the same way, so "equals" becomes (= arg arg). It has been very interesting to learn and I have honestly had quite
a bit of fun learning about this language, as it seems to be pretty unique.
