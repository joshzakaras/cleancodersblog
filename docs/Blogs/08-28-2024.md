It's been a little bit since my last post, but a lot of work has been done since then. I have progressed through the Euler problems, and am currently on Problem 4. Today, I had my first IPM, where we reviewed my solutions to the first 3 Euler problems, and realized that I still had a problem with looping code when it wasn't needed. Instead, I can use something called a "lazy sequence" to my advantage. What a lazy sequence does is essentially not generate or store any values that are not needed, so for example if I want to do something to the numbers within the range 1 and 4, the full sequence of those numbers would be 1,2,3,4. However, because of the way clojure functions, it wont generate or store any of those numbers until they are actually needed. So, if, for example, I only want to take the number 2 from that list, I could run the lazy sequence through a filter function, and it would only save the number 2. I used this, and other gained knowledge, to refactor a few of my previous Euler solutions. Additionally, I started on a Kata, in which I writen the same piece of code every day until I've mastered the creation of it. I'm doing this with a function where I have to generate all of the prime numbers of n. Today it took a few hours to do, however I ended up with a piece of code I'm really proud of, as it's efficient, only 3 lines long, and very readable. Hopefully I'll do a good job of practicing it again tomorrow.
