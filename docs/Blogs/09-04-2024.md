Today I worked through the 7th Euler. This one was pretty tough, as I had to generate the 10,001st prime number.
I solved this problem by iterating through every number and checking if it was prime until I had 10,001 of them. Then,
to check if a number is prime, I checked if it had any factors. I think my solution for this problem works, however I am
unhappy with my implementation, as it takes around 40 seconds to calculate. One minor optimization I made is making the
list start at 3, and only check odd numbers, then adding 2 to the front of the list.
