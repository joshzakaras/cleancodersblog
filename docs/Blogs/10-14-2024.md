## 10-24-2024 | Spit and Slurp

These are pretty cool functions. Essentially, it's a really easy way of reading and writing files in clojure. Normally, when you
write or read in programming, you have to do a bit of setup before reading or writing with a file. However, in clojure, you can just spit
content to a file, or slurp content from a file, by simply giving it the files location. For example, in the tic tac toe program I am currently
creating, to store my game board in a file, all I have to do is write `(spit "some-file" game-board)`. This makes it really convenient to store stuff,
which I originally thought was going to be a headache. Another cool thing, is if I want to simply get the game board from the file I just spit to,
all I have to do is slurp some file, then use read-string, like so:
```clojure
(-> (slurp "some-file")
    (read-string))
```
and it will return the game-board, fully ready to be used by my program.
