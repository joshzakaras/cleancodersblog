## 11-04-2024 | Multimethods

Multimethods are a cool function I've been learning about in clojure. I did some pretty surface level googling to see if 
any other languages used multimethods, or have something similar, but I was unable to find anything concrete. Multimethods
are basically a state machines best friend. You can pass in a variable (usually a key value pair) and use it to determine which
version of the multimethod you want to use. For example:
```clojure
(defmulti getIceCream :flavor)

(defmethod getIceCream :vanilla [order])

(defmethod getIceCream :chocolate [order])
```

This will use the flavor portion of the order set to determine which ice cream function to use. This is also convenient because
it doesn't remove the flavor from the order, it persists through the method unless changed by something in the method. This is really
convenient as you don't need to worry about constantly adding or removing parts of the set.
