## 09-23-2024 | Bowling Kata

I recently had to make a video showcasing a bowling kata. You might be wondering what a "kata" is, and I can help. A kata
is a style of learning programming where you program the same (usually pretty simple) algorithm over and over again until
you've mastered it. It can help a lot with efficiency, even though it doesn't seem like it. I really enjoyed this kata,
and the solution was honestly quite interesting. I basically created an infinite lazy sequence that takes all of the bowling
rolls, turns them into frames, and then scores the first 10 of them. This easily avoids all the forethought about how
or what to do with those pesky extra frames, and a lot more as well.
