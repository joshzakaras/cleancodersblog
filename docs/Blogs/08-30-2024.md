Today I caught up on my video backlog. I had 6 videos I needed to watch, about clean coding. The videos went over a
ton of different design models that make coding easier and cleaner. The first model I learned about was TDD, or
Test Driven Development. This makes refactoring, or cleaning code, a lot easier, as well as ensures that there are no
bugs that get sent off when the code is done. After this, I learned about architecture. Architecture is the way we design our
code in order to allow for the most decisions about what we need for our code to be pushed back. The core of this video talks
about designing around "use cases" and making sure our code looks like the use case and not the interface. For example,
you want your code about an accounting software to look like accounting software, instead of a web server. If we have our
application be developed for the use cases, we can keep things like our database and user interface as separate entities,
which can be changed however we like with minimal effect on our application. The last video talks about SOLID principles,
which ensures that the code is as easy to maintain as possible. It ensures that when you change one module of your code,
the other modules are unaffected. This also allows for faster development times, as when you want to change something about
a specific module, you can feel safe in doing so without needing to worry about your entire application crashing and burning
around you.
