Quil is a pretty cool graphics tool that I've been using to create a GUI for my Tic Tac Toe project. It's nice because all you have to do is create a set of a few
different functions for the program to call, and then package them all into a defsketch method. Once that method is called, it will update the sketch on a frame interval
which can either be a default value or one you select. Additionally, drawing is as easy as just running a function inside of the "draw" method that you pass to the sketch.
For example, if I wanted to just simply draw a square, all I have to do is write the following:

```clojure
(defn draw []
      (quil/rect x y width height))

(quil/defsketch
  :draw draw)
```

And it will draw a square at the specified spot on the screen. Additionally, it has listeners that you can implement for various user actions, such as clicking a mouse somewhere on the sketch.
