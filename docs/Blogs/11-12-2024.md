This is a continuation of yesterday's post about minimax.

If you're like me, you might hear the word "recursive" and get worried about optimization. And you would be right.
This algorithm is super expensive in earlier turns of the board. But there are a few ways to solve this.

#### Maximum Depth

This option essentially caps the amount of turns the algorithm searches before giving up. The main issue with this is that
it can lead to less accurate results, however, if selected properly, it can do a good job of cutting out massive amounts of
branches from the algorithm tree. Think of it like setting a forest on fire.

#### Alpha Beta

This is a small addition to minimax that basically looks 1 turn into the future, and sees if there is an immediate end condition.
If there is, it calculates the branch score off of those end conditions, and returns that instead. This is helpful for if taking
this turn would guarantee that you lose, even if there's the possibility of your opponent missing a move.
