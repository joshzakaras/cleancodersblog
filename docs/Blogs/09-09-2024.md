Today I worked on the 9th euler problem. For this one, I had to find a pythagorean triplet (a < b < c that satisfies
the pythagorean theorem), and find the triplet that adds up to 1000 (a + b + c = 1000). I did this by going through all
of the numbers 1 through 1000, and then generate potential triplets, when it found the correct triplet it stored it.
