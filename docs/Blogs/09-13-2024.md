## 09-13-2024 | Test Driven Development

Test Driven Development (TDD) is pretty cool. If you don't know what it is, it turns programming into a 3-step process:
1. Write a useful test that makes your code fail
2. Make the test pass
3. Refactor your code

These simple steps make it really easy to manage large amounts of code, as when you need to change something, or refactor
code later on, as long as all of your tests pass, you know that your code will still work. I recently had a fun interaction with TDD.
I had forgotten to follow the principles, and when I did that, my mentor told me to throw out my code and rewrite it following TDD.
I thought this was pretty harsh at first, but then when I went and redid my code, I found that it was a lot sleeker. It also got me
to come up with a pretty cool way of handling diagonals, which I discussed in my previous blog post. Sometimes it can be tough to
do TDD, but when you make yourself do it, you will find that your code is usually cleaner, and easier to refactor and optimize.
