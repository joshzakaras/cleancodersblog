## 09-25-2024 | Fizz Buzz

Fizz Buzz is a pretty fun little programming challenge. It's pretty well known, but if you haven't heard of it, here are the rules.
```
1. If a number does not match any of the other rules, print the number
2. If a number is a multiple of 3, print "Fizz"
3. If a number is a multiple of 5, print "Buzz"
4. If a number is a multiple of both, print "FizzBuzz"
```
The solution to this little game is also quite simple, it's just a few conditionals and then you're well on your way! However,
refactoring it can be a little bit interesting. I was able to do something interesting, where instead of evaluating the multiples
separately, I evaluate them in a chain, which cleans up the code a bit as I no longer need a conditional for 3 AND 5, instead it
evaluates individually, and is able to just handle combining the strings.
```clojure
(as-> [] output
      (if (multiple-of-3? input)
        (cons "Fizz" output)
       output)
      (if (multiple-of-5? input)
        (cons "Buzz" output)))
```
