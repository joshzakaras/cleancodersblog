## 09-24-2024 | Developing with others

I had an interesting experience today. I was looking at some of my old git repos for my high school robotics class, and I noticed
something that made me even more curious. When I was a senior in high school, about to leave my robotics team forever, I had tried
to set up my code in a way so that the next programmer that came along would have a good base to start from. I had all of these different
design features and utility perks, all of which I had used when developing my code for the robotics class. However, the newer students
didn't seem to use it at all. I thought it was interesting how it doesn't matter what you do, someone else will want to rework your code
entirely, for a multitude of different reasons. It's almost like you're attaching a part of yourself to a living thing, and it's
always evolving and mutating.
