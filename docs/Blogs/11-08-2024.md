## 11-08-2024 | Reflecting on old code

Today, I had to go back and refactor some old tic tac toe code that I had written, at this point, several months ago, when
I noticed something cool. Most of my functions, other than 2 or 3 of them, were already good to go with the new functionality
I was implementing. This was cool to me, as it allowed me to really see why the SOLID principles are a good idea to implement.
As for the functions I had to change, I had very little to change. For the most part it was changing a part of the function
that was just a static number to a variable number based on the input. In one case I did have to rework the entire function,
but it wasn't too much effort to do.
