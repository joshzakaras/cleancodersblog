## 09-19-2024 | Liskov Substitution Principle

This principle has a complicated sounding name, but it's actually quite simple. It simply states that functions that call a
superclass should be able to use the subclasses of that superclass as well, and that subclasses should have all of the functionality
that the super class has. An example of this is....going back to ice cream. If I have 3 different flavors, I want to be able
to check how much of each flavor is left in the machine, I want a function that grabs one serving of the flavor, etc. ALl of this
could obviously be contained in some "ice cream" super class that allows me to just pass any flavor I want into an ice cream
method and not have to worry about it.
