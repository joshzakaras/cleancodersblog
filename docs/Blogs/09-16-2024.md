## 09-16-2024 | Lazy Sequences

In clojure, we can make a function return what's known as a lazy sequence. I recently did this in order to help solve an
euler problem. A lazy sequence is essentially a way to generate an infinite list of numbers without taking up memory. It does this
by saving each index as a formula, which it calculates when that index is asked for. What's nice about this, is it will cache the
results that you have already asked for, and you're able to throw out this cache whenever you want. This gives you great control
over your lazy sequence, and lets you do cool stuff with it.

However, for this problem, all I needed was to generate an infinite sequence until I found a number in the sequence that satisfies
a condition. Writing the code for it was pretty simple, as shown below in clojure.

```clojure
(defn triangle-numbers
  ([] (triangle-numbers 1))
  ([n] (lazy-seq (cons (apply + (range 1 (inc n))) (triangle-numbers (inc n))))))
```

This sequence is basically generating a number where it's equal to the sum of 1 to the index n. So the first three terms in the sequence are
```
1: 1
3: 1 + 2
6: 1 + 2 + 3
```
And it follows this pattern forever.
