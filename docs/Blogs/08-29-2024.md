Today I started off by practicing my prime numbers kata. I was able to do it quite quickly today, and later my coworker
Merl helped me perfect the refactoring of the code. After that, I worked on Euler 4 for the rest of the day. Today I was
able to solve the Euler, however it took a bit of help. Basically, I was trying to do this really complicated thing where
I take a number, split it into the digits of that number (ex. 99 into [9 9]), however I was struggling to check if that
list was a palindrome. Merl helped me to realize that all I had to do was reverse the number, instead of trying to check
the numbers from out to in. I think the main reason I was struggling with this Euler is that I had pigeonholed myself
into a specific solution, which led to me taking far longer on the solution than I needed to. After I got through that,
it was very simple to complete the rest of the Euler by generating a list of all the numbers with a certain number of
digits, and then multiplying the list by itself, and then grabbing the largest palindrome from this new list. Tomorrow I
plan on checking with my mentor to ensure that there isn't a cleaner way of doing this, as I want my code to be as 
efficient as possible.
