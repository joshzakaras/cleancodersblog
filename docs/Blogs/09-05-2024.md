Today I worked on my eighth euler problem. For this problem, I had to take a 1000 digit number, and find the 13 adjacent
numbers that multiplied together to have the biggest product. To be honest, the hardest part of this was just handling
the number, and turning it into a usable form of data. What I did was convert it into a string from an int, which allows
for way easier conversion into an array of individual values. Then, I used a function that went over the entire list,
and generated all of the 13 digit number sequences, and picked the largest one.
