## 09-26-2024 | Refactoring with TDD

Refactoring with TDD was honestly a pretty cool experience. Unfortunately this week I had to start by refactoring my test
cases, as they weren't entirely formatted correctly. However, I'm pretty happy with the way they turned out, and once I 
had them fixed, refactoring the rest of my code was pretty quick. I was easily able to add in features that before using TDD,
probably would've taken me a lot longer, with a lot more effort. For example, adding a new input that changes the game mode took
less than an hour, barely even 30 minutes not including test refactoring time.
