## 09-18-2024 | TDD....again

Today I had to start on a project, and use TDD on the whole thing. It was honestly quite a cool experience as I think I learned
a lot from it. In the beginning I was thinking about how everything would be structured, what all the different functions I needed to have were,
and how I was going to make this game. Then, I realized if I follow TDD properly....I actually needed barely anything in order
to complete the project! There are still some things I need to work out however, and I think a lot of it just comes down to practice
writing tests to do what I want.
