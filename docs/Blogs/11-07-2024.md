## 11-07-2024 | Dependency Inversion

Dependency Inversion is the last of the SOLID principles. I was tasked with presenting it this week so I figured I would
talk about what it is in a blog post. Essentially, it boils down to separating high order methods from low order methods.
High order methods are things that are more related to overarching program function, while low order methods are things
relating to specific parts of the program. Dependency Inversion is nice because it can help your program follow some of
the other SOLID principles. You implement this principle by putting an abstraction layer between the two types of principles.
One example of this, from the tic tac toe code I'm developing, is the core class. It contains a few methods that are used
by both user interfaces. The user interfaces are able to both implement the methods differently, which allows main to 
just use the core methods, and have everything work out without knowing what's happening behind the scenes.
